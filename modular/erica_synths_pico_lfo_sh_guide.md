## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

*Erica Synths Pico LFO/S&H - Dual analog modulation utility with simultaneous LFO and sample & hold processing*

**What is Pico LFO/S&H?** A fully analog dual utility module combining a low frequency oscillator with simultaneous triangle and square outputs, plus a sample & hold circuit. It's the fundamental modulation source that every rack needs, condensed into just 3HP.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Width:** 3 HP
- **Depth:** 35 mm
- **Power:** 13 mA @ +12V / 10 mA @ -12V / 0 mA @ +5V
- **Architecture:** Fully analog dual utility (LFO + Sample & Hold)

### Your First LFO Modulation
1. **Turn Rate knob** to 12 o'clock position
2. **Watch the LED** blink - this shows your LFO speed
3. **Patch Triangle output** → your filter cutoff CV input
4. **Patch Square output** → your sequencer clock input (if desired)
5. **Play a sequence** - notice the smooth filter sweeps and rhythmic pulses
6. **Adjust Rate knob** - hear how it changes both the modulation speed and clock tempo

### Your First Sample & Hold
1. **Keep the LFO running** (LED blinking)
2. **Patch any CV source** → **S&H CV Input** (try another LFO or noise)
3. **Patch S&H Output** → your oscillator pitch CV
4. **Nothing in S&H Clock?** It automatically uses the internal LFO as clock
5. **Result:** Stepped random pitch changes in sync with your LFO rate!

## Essential Parameters (The Big 3)

### **1. Rate Knob + LED**
- **What it does:** Controls LFO frequency from 0.4Hz to 20Hz
- **Musical result:** Slow = long evolving sweeps, Fast = vibrato/tremolo speeds
- **LED feedback:** Visual indication of current LFO rate
- **Dual purpose:** Sets both modulation speed AND sample rate (when S&H clock is unpatched)

### **2. LFO Outputs (Triangle + Square)**
- **Triangle:** Smooth, continuous modulation - perfect for filters, pitch, amplitude
- **Square:** Hard on/off switching - great for clock signals, gate triggers, on/off switching
- **Simultaneous:** Both outputs run at the same rate but different shapes
- **Range:** ±5V output on both waveforms

### **3. Sample & Hold Circuit**
- **CV Input:** What gets sampled - can be any audio or CV signal
- **Clock Input:** When to sample (if empty, uses internal LFO automatically)
- **S&H Output:** Stepped voltages that hold until next clock pulse
- **Creative use:** Turn smooth signals into stepped/quantized versions

## Historical Context

### **LFO and Sample & Hold in Modular History**
Low Frequency Oscillators and Sample & Hold circuits represent two of the most fundamental modulation concepts in electronic music synthesis. LFOs emerged in the 1960s as a way to create vibrato and tremolo effects automatically, while Sample & Hold circuits were developed to capture and quantize random voltages for musical purposes. These functions became essential building blocks in early modular systems like Moog and Buchla synthesizers.

### **The Evolution of Modulation Utilities**
Early modular systems required separate modules for LFO generation and Sample & Hold processing, often consuming significant rack space for basic modulation needs. The development of compact, multi-function modulation utilities like the Pico series revolutionized modular synthesis by proving that essential functions could coexist efficiently without compromising analog character or functionality.

### **Analog vs Digital Modulation**
The Pico LFO/S&H maintains pure analog signal paths, preserving the subtle characteristics and natural drift that define analog modulation. This approach ensures compatibility with vintage synthesis techniques while providing the reliability and precision needed for modern modular systems. The module represents the philosophy that fundamental utilities should be transparent, reliable, and immediately musical.

## Understanding Sample & Hold

### **How S&H Works:**
1. **Sample:** At each clock pulse, S&H "looks at" the voltage at CV Input
2. **Hold:** Maintains that exact voltage until the next clock pulse
3. **Step:** Creates stepped, staircase-like voltage patterns
4. **Result:** Smooth signals become discrete, stepped sequences

### **Clock Source Options:**
- **No Clock patched:** Uses internal LFO (Rate knob controls sample rate)
- **External Clock:** Patch any pulse/gate signal for independent timing
- **LFO Square out → S&H Clock:** Create rhythmic relationships
- **Other modules:** Sequencer gates, burst generators, etc.

### **CV Input Applications:**
- **Noise sources:** Creates random voltage sequences
- **Other LFOs:** Turn smooth LFOs into stepped sequences  
- **Audio signals:** Sample audio for unusual CV patterns
- **Manual voltage:** Use offset/attenuator modules for controlled values

## Common Mistakes

### **Common Mistake Patterns:**

**"My S&H isn't changing!"**
- Need a clock signal to trigger sampling
- **Solution:** Either patch an external clock or leave S&H Clock empty to use internal LFO

**"The S&H output is always the same voltage!"**
- CV Input might be receiving a static voltage
- **Solution:** Patch a changing signal (noise, LFO, audio) to S&H CV Input

**"My LFO is too fast/too slow!"**
- 0.4Hz-20Hz range might not cover your needs
- **Solution:** Use clock dividers/multipliers on square output, or different LFO modules for extreme ranges

### **Pro Tips:**

**Rate Knob Sweet Spots:**
- **7-9 o'clock:** Very slow, evolving textures (great for ambient)
- **10-2 o'clock:** Musical modulation rates (most common usage)
- **3-5 o'clock:** Fast tremolo/vibrato effects and rapid S&H patterns

**S&H Timing Strategy:**
- **Internal LFO clocking:** Simple, everything synced to one rate
- **External clocking:** Independent control of sample rate vs. modulation speed
- **Audio rate clocking:** Creates digital-style artifacts and bit reduction

**Output Voltage Management:**
- **±5V outputs:** May need attenuation for modules expecting 0-5V
- **Triangle scaling:** Use attenuverters to control modulation depth
- **Square as gate:** Perfect voltage levels for most gate inputs

**Performance Techniques:**
- **Rate sweeps:** Dramatic builds by slowly increasing LFO speed
- **S&H source switching:** Change what's being sampled for different textures
- **Clock pattern variations:** Use different rhythmic clocks for evolving S&H patterns
