# Tiptop Audio Forbidden Planet - Beginner's Guide

**The Steiner-Parker Synthacon Filter Reborn**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Forbidden Planet?** An analog multimode filter inspired by the legendary 1975 Steiner-Parker Synthacon, featuring three separate inputs (HP, BP, LP) instead of typical mode switching. It's famous for its crisp high-pass filtering, unique resonance behavior, and sci-fi self-oscillation capabilities.

### Your First Classic Lowpass Sweep
1. **Turn RESO** all the way down (counterclockwise)
2. **Patch sawtooth wave** → **LP IN** (lowpass input)
3. **Set VOLUME** to around 3 o'clock
4. **Connect output** → your mixer/amp
5. **Slowly turn FREQUENCY** knob full scale - hear the classic filter sweep
6. **Gradually increase RESO** - listen as it goes from smooth to self-oscillating madness!

### Discover the Signature High-Pass
1. **Unplug from LP IN** and **patch same signal** → **HP IN**
2. **Set FREQUENCY to minimum** (9 o'clock)
3. **Slowly turn FREQUENCY up** - notice how highs cut through with "no residue"
4. **Try on kick drums** - removes rumble while keeping punch!

## Essential Parameters (The Big 5)

### **1. Three Input Jacks (HP, BP, LP)**
- **HP IN:** High-pass input - "signature sound" with crisp, sharp cuts
- **BP IN:** Band-pass input - isolates "pie-slice" frequency ranges  
- **LP IN:** Low-pass input - classic "airy" 12dB/octave slope
- **Unique feature:** Can use all three simultaneously for complex filtering
- **Key difference:** Inputs, not outputs - each processes signal differently

### **2. FREQUENCY Control**
- **What it does:** Sets cutoff frequency for all active filter modes
- **Range:** Wide frequency sweep from bass to treble
- **Behavior:** Works in "reverse direction" for HP compared to LP
- **Performance control:** Primary real-time filter manipulation

### **3. RESO (Resonance)**
- **What it does:** Internal feedback path emphasizing cutoff frequencies
- **Low settings:** Smooth harmonic emphasis
- **Medium settings:** Self-oscillation begins (filter becomes sine oscillator)
- **Maximum settings:** "Aggressive and scattered" - chaotic, grainy sci-fi tones
- **Unique trait:** Volume doesn't drop when resonance increases (unlike many filters)

### **4. CV Inputs (Attenuated + Full)**
- **Attenuated CV:** Has dedicated attenuator knob for precise control
- **Full CV:** Direct CV input with no attenuation
- **Use both:** Combine envelope + LFO modulation simultaneously
- **Creative tip:** Manual suggests trying audio signals in CV inputs!

### **5. VOLUME Control**
- **What it does:** Master output level control
- **Necessity:** No input level controls, so output volume is your gain staging
- **Range:** Controls final output from filter circuit
- **Performance use:** Quick level adjustments during play

## Historical Context

Nyle Steiner was born in 1945 in American Fork, Utah, and came to synthesis from the performer's side of the room. A classically trained trumpet player who had worked with the Utah Symphony, he spent the early 1970s designing electronic instruments that could give wind players the same expressive vocabulary over synthesizer voices that a brass player already had over pitch, dynamics, and articulation — work that eventually became the EVI, Electronic Valve Instrument. That starting point matters: Steiner understood a filter not as a circuit specification but as something a musician would hold and move in real time. When he formed Steiner-Parker with electrical engineer Dick Parker and launched the Synthacon in 1975 as an affordable competitor to the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, that performing musician's perspective ran through every decision.

The filter Steiner designed for the Synthacon was built on a Sallen-Key topology, a circuit architecture published in 1955 by R.P. Sallen and E.L. Key at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The topology gave Steiner an efficient two-pole 12dB per octave slope, but what he did with it structurally had no precedent in production synthesizers. Every other multimode filter of the era routed a single input signal through the circuit and selected low-pass, high-pass, or bandpass at the output. Steiner inverted this logic: three separate inputs, one for each filter mode, feeding into a single output. You selected the response by choosing which input to send signal into, not which output to read from. Multiple signals could enter different inputs simultaneously and the filter would process all of them internally, each path interacting with the others before reaching the output. The three inputs were not a convenience feature — they were a fundamentally different model of what a filter is for.

The filter also behaved differently from the transistor-ladder designs that Moog and ARP had made standard. In a ladder filter, the internal feedback path that builds resonance pulls energy away from the main signal, so increasing resonance drops output volume. Players learned to compensate — pushing level as they pushed resonance — until the two adjustments became a single learned habit. Steiner's positive feedback approach kept output volume stable through the full resonance range. Resonance could be used as a purely tonal decision, not a gain management problem. At maximum settings the filter self-oscillated aggressively, producing complex harmonic content rather than the relatively clean sine that most filters generated, and the volume held steady all the way to chaos.

The Synthacon was manufactured between 1975 and 1979, and the filter circuit largely disappeared from production instruments for the following decades. It survived in DIY documentation and a small community of builders who recognized the distinctive behavior of the three-input design. Tiptop Audio brought it into the Eurorack format as Forbidden Planet — named after the 1956 science fiction film, which was the first major Hollywood production to use a fully electronic score. Louis and Bebe Barron built custom ring modulators and manipulated tape to produce sounds the Musician's Union refused to classify as music. The name connects the module to that moment: a piece of technology that arrived before the mainstream had a framework for it, doing something structurally unlike what came before it, named for the place where that kind of sound was expected to originate.

## Common Mistakes

### **Common Mistakes:**

**"The high-pass works backwards!"**
- HP frequency control is inverted compared to LP - this is normal
- **Solution:** For HP, low FREQUENCY = more highs, high FREQUENCY = less highs

**"I can't get the resonance to self-oscillate!"**
- Need to find the right frequency range for self-oscillation
- **Solution:** Try different FREQUENCY positions while increasing RESO

**"The filter doesn't have enough low-end when self-oscillating!"**
- Known limitation - self-oscillation cuts out below ~150Hz
- **Solution:** Use other filters for low-frequency self-oscillation, or layer with sub-oscillators

### **Pro Tips:**

**Input Selection Strategy:**
- **LP IN:** For traditional filter sweeps, bass synthesis, warm sounds
- **HP IN:** For crisp cuts, drum processing, removing mud
- **BP IN:** For focused leads, vocal textures, frequency isolation

**Resonance Sweet Spots:**
- **9-11 o'clock:** Subtle harmonic emphasis
- **12-2 o'clock:** Musical resonance without self-oscillation  
- **3-4 o'clock:** Self-oscillation begins - filter becomes oscillator
- **5 o'clock:** Maximum chaos - grainy, aggressive sci-fi tones

**CV Modulation Tips:**
- **Use both CV inputs:** Envelope for dynamics, LFO for movement
- **Attenuated CV:** Start with small amounts, increase gradually
- **Audio rate modulation:** Try audio signals in CV inputs for complex interactions
- **1V/Oct tracking:** When self-oscillating, filter tracks musically

**Performance Techniques:**
- **Resonance sweeps:** Classic build-up and breakdown technique
- **Input hopping:** Move signals between inputs for instant timbre changes
- **Self-oscillation mode:** Remove input, use filter as sound source
- **Multiple inputs:** Process different elements of your mix simultaneously
