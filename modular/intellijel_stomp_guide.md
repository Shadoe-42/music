## Quick Start: Get Your First Modular-to-Pedal Chain in 5 Minutes

**What is Stomp?** A specialized interface module that bridges the gap between Eurorack modular and guitar/bass pedal ecosystems, providing proper impedance matching, level conversion, and CV-controlled expression pedal automation.

### Your First Modular-to-Pedal Chain
1. **Connect modular source** - Patch your oscillator or voice to Stomp's ¼" SEND output
2. **Set level switch** - Use LINE mode for modular sources, INST for guitars/basses
3. **Connect pedal chain** - SEND → your pedal → pedal output back to Stomp's ¼" RETURN input
4. **Adjust MIX control** - Balance between dry modular signal and processed pedal return
5. **Monitor output** - Take mixed signal from Stomp's modular output back to your system

**Congratulations!** You've just processed modular synthesis through guitar pedals with proper impedance matching!

## Essential Parameters (The Bridge Controls)

### **1. LEVEL Switch - The Impedance Selector**
- **What it does:** Switches between instrument-level (INST) and line-level (LINE) operation
- **Character:** INST mode for guitars/basses, LINE mode for modular/synth sources
- **Settings:** INST (high-impedance guitar input), LINE (modular/synth levels)
- **CV controllable:** No - hardware switch only
- **Pro tip:** LINE mode is essential for proper modular signal levels

### **2. MIX Control - The Wet/Dry Balance**
- **What it does:** Blends between dry input signal and processed pedal return
- **Character:** CCW = full dry signal, CW = full pedal-processed signal, 12 o'clock = balanced mix
- **Range descriptions:** CCW (dry only), 12 o'clock (50/50 blend), CW (pedal only)
- **CV controllable:** Yes - CV input with attenuverter
- **Pro tip:** Use CV control for automated effect send amounts

### **3. EXPR LEVEL - The Expression Scaling**
- **What it does:** Controls the amount of CV sent to expression pedal outputs
- **Character:** Scales CV signals to proper expression pedal voltage ranges (0-3.3V)
- **Range descriptions:** CCW (no expression), 12 o'clock (moderate), CW (maximum expression range)
- **CV controllable:** No - manual control only
- **Pro tip:** Start at 12 o'clock and adjust based on pedal response

### **4. LFO RATE - The Internal Modulation Speed**
- **What it does:** Sets speed of internal LFO for expression pedal automation
- **Character:** Slow modulation to fast tremolo-like rates
- **Range descriptions:** CCW (very slow, ~30 seconds), 12 o'clock (musical rates), CW (audio rate)
- **CV controllable:** Yes - CV input overrides manual control when patched
- **Pro tip:** Musical rates (9-3 o'clock) work best for most expression applications

### **5. LFO SHAPE - The Waveform Selector**
- **What it does:** Selects waveform for internal LFO
- **Character:** Different mathematical curves for varied expression pedal automation
- **Range descriptions:** Triangle, Sine, Square, Random shapes available
- **CV controllable:** No - manual selection only
- **Pro tip:** Sine and triangle waves provide smoothest expression pedal control

### **6. Expression Outputs - The CV-to-Expression Bridge**
- **What it does:** Converts modular CV signals to expression pedal control voltages
- **Character:** Unipolar 0-3.3V range compatible with most expression pedal inputs
- **Signal type:** Unipolar CV, automatically scaled from bipolar modular sources
- **CV controllable:** These ARE the CV outputs for pedal expression control
- **Pro tip:** Use TRS cables for expression pedal connections

## Why Intellijel Stomp Excels

Guitar pedals and Eurorack modular systems exist in different electrical worlds: pedals expect high-impedance instrument signals or balanced line levels, modular runs unbalanced at Eurorack levels, and expression pedals communicate via a 0-3.3V unipolar voltage range that has no natural equivalent in a standard modular patch. Most attempts to bridge these worlds involve compromises: signal loss, impedance mismatches, ground loops, or a pile of passive adapters that solve one problem while creating two others. Stomp is built from the ground up to solve all of it in 6HP.

The LEVEL switch is the critical piece that most DIY approaches miss. Proper high-impedance buffering for guitars and basses versus correct gain staging for modular-level signals is not a passive problem. Stomp handles the conversion in both directions cleanly, which means the pedal on the other end receives the signal it was designed for rather than something that technically works but sounds wrong.

The expression automation circuit is where Stomp earns its place in a system beyond basic send/return duty. Any pedal with an expression input becomes a CV-addressable modular effect. The internal LFO driving the expression output is a legitimate modulation source in its own right: slow sine automation on a reverb decay time, triangle sweeps on a chorus rate, or random waveform control over a filter. Replace the internal LFO with an external CV source and the automation becomes as sophisticated as anything else in the system. This turns a static pedal into a dynamic, parameter-modulated processor without modifying the pedal or adding any external conversion hardware.

The practical consequence is that an existing pedal collection stops being a separate domain and becomes an extension of the modular signal chain. Distortion boxes, boutique reverbs, vintage chorus units, tape echo emulations: any of them can be inserted into a modular patch with correct levels and come back out addressable by CV. That is a significant expansion of available processing without adding rack modules, and Stomp is the single module that enables it.

## Common Mistakes

### **"The pedal isn't doing anything — signal is bypassed!"**
**Why it happens:** The LEVEL switch is set to INST but you're sending modular-level audio (or vice versa). INST expects high-impedance, instrument-level signals; modular outputs are line-level and will either overdrive or barely register.
**Solution:** Set LEVEL to LINE for any modular source. Use INST only for actual guitar or bass input.

### **"Expression control isn't reaching the full parameter range on my pedal!"**
**Why it happens:** Expression pedals expect TRS (stereo) cable connections, not TS (mono). With a TS cable, the wiper and one of the other terminals are shorted — the control range collapses.
**Solution:** Use TRS cables from Stomp's Expression outputs to the pedal's expression input. If range is still limited, adjust EXPR LEVEL.

### **"The effect sounds dry even though it's patched through Stomp!"**
**Why it happens:** Two separate mix controls exist: Stomp's MIX knob AND the pedal's own wet/dry blend. A fully dry result usually means the pedal's internal mix is at zero, not Stomp's.
**Solution:** Check the pedal's own mix or effects level control first. Stomp's MIX only blends the signal Stomp receives back from the pedal — it can't compensate for a pedal that outputs nothing wet.

### **"There's a loud hum or buzz when the pedal is patched in!"**
**Why it happens:** Ground loops between the pedal's wall-wart power supply and the modular's PSU are extremely common. Pedals and Eurorack share chassis ground through the patch cables, creating a loop antenna.
**Solution:** Power the pedal from an isolated, floating output on a dedicated pedal power supply (Cioks, Strymon Zuma, Voodoo Lab). Daisy-chaining or using cheap single-output adapters almost always creates hum.

### **"The LFO automation sounds robotic — no variation!"**
**Why it happens:** The internal LFO waveform is set to Square, which produces abrupt jumps rather than smooth sweeps. Expression pedals are designed for continuous control; stepped CV sounds unnatural.
**Solution:** Switch LFO SHAPE to Sine or Triangle for smooth, organic sweeps. For more interesting automation, replace the internal LFO with an external source like Ochd patched into the CV input.
