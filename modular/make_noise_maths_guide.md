## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Maths?** Think of it as four powerful tools in one module: two envelope generators, two offset generators, and a mixer that can combine them all.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Width:** 20 HP
- **Depth:** 38 mm
- **Power:** 90 mA @ +12V / 90 mA @ -12V / 0 mA @ +5V

### Your First Envelope (Channel 1)
1. **Patch a trigger/gate** → Channel 1 **TRIG** input (top left)
2. **Turn Rise and Fall knobs** to 12 o'clock position  
3. **Patch Channel 1 Unity output** → your VCA CV input
4. **Trigger it!** You should see the LED light up and hear your envelope working

**Congratulations!** You just made Maths work as an envelope generator.

## Essential Parameters (The Big 4)

### **1. Rise Time** 
- **What it does:** Controls how fast the envelope goes UP
- **Musical result:** Attack time - fast = snappy drums, slow = swells
- **Range:** Instant to 25 minutes(!!)

### **2. Fall Time**
- **What it does:** Controls how fast the envelope goes DOWN  
- **Musical result:** Release/decay time - fast = plucks, slow = fade-outs
- **Range:** Instant to 25 minutes

### **3. Cycle Button**
- **What it does:** Makes the envelope repeat automatically = LFO
- **Musical result:** Press it and your envelope becomes a wobbling LFO
- **Try this:** Press cycle, turn Rise/Fall to different positions, patch to filter cutoff

### **4. Attenuverters (Center Knobs)**
- **What they do:** Control the strength and direction of each channel
- **12 o'clock = no effect**, **clockwise = positive**, **counter-clockwise = negative/inverted**

## Historical Context: Why Everyone Has One

Maths arrived at a crucial moment in modular synthesis: when DIY culture and Eurorack were expanding beyond specialists and into the hands of musicians who needed to *understand* what was happening, not just use it.

Before Maths, you needed separate modules for envelopes, LFOs, mixers, and slew limiters. Maths unified them into one design that revealed *how they were all the same thing*; different applications of the same analog mathematical principle: voltage integration. This wasn't just space-efficient; it was philosophically revolutionary. It taught that synthesis is fundamentally about voltage relationships, not isolated features.

The module became a standard; arguably *the* standard teaching tool for analog synthesis. If you wanted to learn modular, you learned Maths. If you built a small system, Maths was non-negotiable. Within the Eurorack community, owning Maths became as foundational as owning a VCA or a filter. It's difficult to find an intermediate or advanced modular synthesizer that doesn't include one.

Why? Because Maths does something almost no other module does: **it teaches you that everything in modular synthesis is fundamentally the same thing**: voltage, time, and mathematical relationships. Once you understand Maths, you understand the entire language of modular synthesis. Every other module becomes a different application of the same principles.

This design philosophy connects directly to the interconnection principle: Maths doesn't exist in isolation. It's the hub through which all other modules speak to each other in the universal language of voltage mathematics. You can't build a sophisticated modular system without understanding how to think like Maths does.

Twenty years of consistency, countless documentation efforts, and the fact that it *still* doesn't have a serious competitor speaks to something rare: a design so fundamentally correct that it becomes transparent. Musicians don't think about whether to use Maths; they think about how. It's the language through which synthesis literacy is transmitted across generations.

## Why This Instrument Excels

### **The Analog Computation Philosophy**

**Maths is not a digital envelope generator.** It's an analog computer; a circuit that performs mathematical operations on electrical voltage in real-time, with zero latency and infinite resolution.

This distinction matters. Digital envelopes calculate envelope shapes and output them as a stream of numbers. Analog envelopes *are electrical processes*; voltage building and falling according to physical laws.

#### **The Mathematical Heart: Integration**

Rise and Fall controls don't just "shape" envelopes. They control **integration**: a core mathematical operation where voltage *accumulates over time*.

When you turn a Rise knob:
1. You apply a constant current to a capacitor
2. The capacitor charges at a rate determined by that current
3. The voltage rises *smoothly and continuously*
4. The output at any moment depends on how long the charging has been happening

This is why Rise and Fall can range from microseconds to 25 minutes; you're literally controlling how fast electricity fills a capacitor. There's no quantization, no sample rate, no digital rounding. Just physics.

**Musical consequence:** Maths envelopes *feel* different because they're not approximations of mathematical curves; they *are* mathematical curves, generated by analog physics.

#### **Thinking in Voltage: The Core Language**

Maths operates in the universal language of modular synthesis: voltage as information.

- **0V = the reference point** (nothing happening)
- **+5V = positive control** (filter opens, amp increases, pitch rises)
- **-5V = negative control** (filter closes, amp decreases, pitch falls)
- **All voltages between = proportional effects**

When you patch a signal into Maths Signal Input, you're not uploading data; you're connecting a continuously varying electrical signal that Maths *reads and transforms in real-time*.

The attenuverter at 12 o'clock = zero voltage passing through (no effect). Turn it clockwise and you're *amplifying* that signal. Turn it counter-clockwise and you're *inverting* it; flipping the polarity so that what goes up comes down.

This is why the attenuverter is not a "volume knob"; it's a **multiplier** that scales voltage relationships.

#### **The Hidden Utility: Voltage Addition (SUM)**

Understanding analog computation reveals Maths' most powerful hidden feature: the SUM output automatically adds voltages together.

If you patch four different sources into Maths channels and turn on all four attenuverters:
- Ch1 Variable = +2V
- Ch2 Variable = +1V  
- Ch3 Variable = -3V
- Ch4 Variable = +4V
- **SUM Output = +4V** (2+1-3+4 = 4)

This isn't a "mixing feature" bolted on; it's the fundamental nature of analog circuits. Voltages naturally add together when they meet at a summing point. Maths exposes this as a feature.

**Musical consequence:** You can design patches where the mathematical relationship of four independent modulation sources creates entirely new control voltages that none of the sources produced alone.

#### **The Hidden Utility: Internal Voltage References**

Channels 2 and 3 have a subtle superpower: when nothing is patched to the Signal input, they *generate* +10V internally.

Why +10V? Because in Eurorack, 1V per octave is the pitch standard. +10V = 10 octaves above reference. With the attenuverter at 12 o'clock, this internal voltage does nothing. But turn the attenuverter to +50% and you've created a fixed +5V offset; a constant voltage that can transpose any sequence without external patching.

Make Noise didn't add a "reference voltage generator"; they designed channels 2 and 3 so that the absence of a patch becomes *a feature*, not a missing cable.

**Musical consequence:** You can perform complex voltage mathematics entirely within Maths, using no external CV sources; just the module's own internal circuitry and your knowledge of how to combine things.

### **Design Reasoning: Why Each Feature Exists**

Every choice Make Noise made for Maths serves a teaching purpose. Understanding the *why* reveals how intentional this design is.

#### **Dual Trigger Types (Signal vs. Trigger Inputs)**

Most modules have one envelope input. Maths has two different ones:
- **Trigger Input** - Always completes its full Rise/Fall cycle, regardless of gate length
- **Signal Input** - Envelope follows the gate length, sustaining while the gate is high

Make Noise included both because they teach different things.

**Trigger Input teaches:** Envelopes have their own timing independent of the gate. You *trigger* a process that unfolds according to its own Rise/Fall settings. This reveals that an envelope is fundamentally a **time-based computation**: it needs a start point and then does its own thing.

**Signal Input teaches:** Envelopes can also follow external control. The gate becomes the modulation source itself; the envelope *tracks* the input. This reveals that Maths channels are flexible: they can be driven by timing or by direct control.

Most musicians will use Trigger Input for drums and percussion (fixed timing) and Signal Input for modulation processing (responsive to external control). This single design choice teaches the entire concept of gate-driven vs. signal-driven modulation.

#### **Normalization (Channels 2 & 3 Generate +10V)**

When you don't patch anything into a Maths channel, most modules would just sit idle. Channels 2 and 3 do something different: they generate +10V internally.

Why not make it the user's responsibility to patch a constant voltage source?

Because **normals teach that absence can be a feature, not a missing cable.** Make Noise is saying: "When you don't patch anything, we automatically provide a useful reference voltage. You can then scale it with the attenuverter."

This single design choice reveals several synthesis principles:
- Voltage references are fundamental to how modular works
- 1V/octave is the universal pitch standard (so +10V is meaningful)
- Attenuverters can create complex relationships from simple internal references
- You don't need external sources to perform mathematics

Every musician who learns Maths by not patching a Signal input and using the internal +10V learns something crucial: **modular systems contain infinite possibilities when you understand the voltage math built into them.**

#### **Attenuverter Design (12 O'Clock = OFF, Not Maximum)**

Most knobs work this way: minimum at 7 o'clock, maximum at 5 o'clock, with the midpoint somewhere in between. Maths attenuverters work differently:
- **12 o'clock = 0% (off, no effect)**
- **Clockwise = positive scaling (0% to +100%)**
- **Counter-clockwise = negative scaling (0% to -100%)**

This is unconventional. Why?

Because it teaches **inversion as a core synthesis concept.** By making "off" the center point, Make Noise forces you to think about direction. When you turn an attenuverter clockwise, you're explicitly choosing to amplify positively. When you turn it counter-clockwise, you're explicitly choosing to invert.

This is not just a UI preference. It teaches that modular synthesis is fundamentally about **polarity and direction of control**, not just quantity. A negative scaling of your LFO creates entirely different musical behavior than positive scaling; not just different amounts, but different *directions*.

Every patch where you've used an attenuverter teaches you to think about the mathematical sign of your modulation, not just its magnitude.

#### **Automatic Summing (SUM Output)**

Maths Variable outputs automatically combine at the SUM output without patching. This seems like a small convenience feature, but it's actually teaching **how analog circuits naturally work.**

In real analog circuitry, when two voltage sources meet at a node, they naturally add together. Make Noise exposed this fundamental principle as a feature instead of hiding it in circuit internals.

**Teaching moment:** The first time you hear Ch1 + Ch2 + Ch3 combining at SUM and creating something none of them produced alone, you've learned that **modular synthesis creates new possibilities through combination.** This is the interconnection principle made tangible. You're not just patching modules; you're creating mathematical relationships that didn't exist before.

#### **Cycle Button (Instant Envelope-to-LFO Transformation)**

The Cycle button does something simple: makes the envelope repeat automatically. But why expose this as a single physical button?

Because it teaches that **envelopes and LFOs are the same thing**, just running at different speeds and with different repeat behavior.

Most musicians learn this eventually through reading and theory. With Maths, you learn it by pressing a button and hearing your envelope become a wobble. Rise and Fall suddenly change meaning; they become speed controls instead of timing controls. The same knobs do completely different things depending on whether you press Cycle.

**Teaching moment:** This single button reveals that in synthesis, categories like "envelope" and "LFO" are not fixed types; they're just different applications of the same voltage generation principle.

#### **Four Channels (Optimal Complexity)**

Why four channels? Why not three? Why not five?

Four is the sweet spot where:
- You can handle most real-world patching situations (4 envelopes, 4 modulation sources, mixing operations)
- Complexity remains manageable for learning (unlike 8+ channel modules)
- The SUM output becomes genuinely useful (combining 4 independent things creates meaningful new possibilities)
- You can still understand the whole circuit architecture

Make Noise could have made Maths bigger. Instead, they designed it to be **completely understandable**. When you grasp all four channels, you're not just using a tool; you've learned the foundational principles of analog computation as applied to music.

#### **20HP Size (Exactly Right)**

Twenty Eurorack units is large enough for:
- Four independent channels with clear panel layout
- Readable labels and reasonable knob spacing
- Easy-to-see LEDs and connections
- Room for internal circuitry that does real work

But small enough that:
- It fits in small systems without dominating
- The entire circuit architecture is graspable (not hidden behind overwhelming complexity)
- It becomes a standard building block, not a rare specialist tool

**Teaching moment:** The physical size encodes a teaching principle. Maths is big enough to be powerful but small enough to be understood. It occupies exactly the design space needed to teach synthesis without overwhelming.

### **The Philosophy & Innovation**

#### **The Philosophy:**
Maths proves that **one excellent module** can replace an entire rack of dedicated functions. It's not just an envelope generator - it's a complete analog computer that thinks in musical time and voltage relationships.

#### **The Innovation:**
- **Four independent channels** that can work alone or together
- **Analog computation** handles addition, integration, and differentiation
- **Normalization system** creates intelligent signal routing without patching
- **Dual trigger types** (Signal vs Trigger inputs) for different envelope behaviors
- **Cycle mode** instantly transforms envelopes into LFOs

#### **The Practical Benefits:**
- **Space efficiency:** Replaces multiple envelope generators, LFOs, mixers, and utilities
- **Learning tool:** Teaches fundamental analog synthesis concepts hands-on
- **Performance oriented:** Cycle buttons enable real-time envelope-to-LFO switching
- **Expandable:** Works alone or as part of larger Make Noise ecosystem

#### **Perfect For:**
- **Beginners:** Learn envelopes, LFOs, and CV mixing in one module
- **West Coast enthusiasts:** Essential for buchla-style modular synthesis
- **Performers:** Real-time control over complex modulation shapes
- **Sound designers:** Complex CV processing and analog computation
- **Small system builders:** Maximum modulation functionality in 20HP

#### **The Magic:**
Maths **thinks in musical time** - from microseconds to half-hours. It's not just generating envelopes, it's performing **analog mathematics** on your musical ideas, creating complex relationships that would require dozens of modules to achieve otherwise.

## Common Mistakes & Pattern Recognition

---

### **Issue 1: "Why doesn't anything happen when I patch my sequencer gate to Trigger but the gate is too short?"**

**Root Cause:** Confusing gate duration with envelope completion timing.

**The WHY Explanation:**
Maths Trigger Input completes its full Rise/Fall cycle regardless of gate length because it solves a specific synthesis problem: envelopes need their own timing, independent of the triggering event. A drum hit might send a 10ms gate, but you want a 500ms envelope decay. The Trigger input says "start my timing now" and then does the complete mathematical operation. This reveals a fundamental truth about synthesis: **envelopes are time-based computations that live independent from the signals that trigger them.** Your gate is just the start button; the envelope's internal timing takes over. This distinction teaches that synthesis operates on two different temporal concepts: events (the gate arriving) and processes (the envelope unfolding).

**Connection to Maths:**
Make Noise deliberately included two different inputs: Trigger and Signal; to force you to understand this distinction. Most envelope generators hide this choice. Maths exposes it because it's fundamental.

**Recognition:**
You hear: "My envelope is cutting off when the gate ends" or "I have to hold the gate long enough for my envelope to complete."

**The Learning:**
Trigger Input = envelope has its own timing. Signal Input = envelope follows gate duration. Use Trigger for independent timing (drums, percussion), Signal for tracking behavior (modulation following a control voltage). This teaches that modulation timing is a choice with musical consequences.

---

### **Issue 2: "Signal Input vs Trigger Input: I still don't know which one to use"**

**Root Cause:** Understanding the difference intellectually but not understanding the musical consequence.

**The WHY Explanation:**
Signal Input tracks the input voltage; when the gate is high, the envelope rises and sustains; when it falls, the envelope decays. Trigger Input ignores gate duration entirely; it gets a pulse, does a complete rise/fall cycle, and stops. Most musicians intuitively want ADSR behavior (Trigger), but Maths actually teaches something deeper: **these are two different ways envelopes can relate to time.** With Trigger, you're saying "time belongs to the envelope." With Signal, you're saying "time follows the incoming gate." Understanding this teaches that modulation is fundamentally about **how one signal's timing relates to another's timing.** This is not a feature choice; it's a conceptual foundation of synthesis.

**Connection to Maths:**
Make Noise exposed both options because they teach different synthesis thinking. Most envelope generators hide this choice. Maths forces you to understand it because understanding timing relationships is how you build sophisticated patches.

**Recognition:**
You find yourself using the "wrong" input and getting unexpected sustain or sudden release behavior.

**The Learning:**
Trigger = independent timing, Signal = responsive to gate length. Both are correct; which you use depends on what you want the envelope to do musically. This teaches that synthesis is about intentional timing choices, not just triggering events.

### **Issue 3: "My knobs don't seem to do anything!"**

**Root Cause:** Misunderstanding attenuverter zero-point and assuming 12 o'clock means maximum.

**The WHY Explanation:**
On most volume knobs, 12 o'clock is full. On Maths attenuverters, 12 o'clock is completely OFF (zero voltage passing through). Clockwise from 12 = positive scaling (amplification). Counter-clockwise from 12 = negative scaling (inversion). This isn't a UI quirk: **it's deliberately teaching that synthesis is fundamentally about polarity and direction, not just quantity.** When you invert a signal, you're not just reducing it; you're flipping its mathematical sign. This is conceptually different from volume. A negative LFO modulation creates entirely different musical results than positive modulation of the same source. Make Noise put zero at the center to force you to think about **mathematical direction as a core synthesis concept.**

**Connection to Maths:**
This design choice encodes a teaching principle: "synthesis operates on polarity." Understanding attenuverters teaches you that modulation isn't unidirectional; it's a choice of mathematical direction.

**Recognition:**
You turn attenuverter knobs and hear no change, or you assume maximum effect at 12 o'clock.

**The Learning:**
12 o'clock = OFF. Clockwise = positive. Counter-clockwise = negative. The attenuverter is a **multiplier of mathematical sign**, not a volume control. Start turning clockwise and listen to the direction of the effect. This teaches that synthesis fundamentally operates on polarity.

### **Issue 4: "Why does nothing happen when I don't patch the Signal input?"**

**Root Cause:** Not understanding that normalization is a design feature, not a missing cable.

**The WHY Explanation:**
Channels 2 and 3 generate +10V internally when nothing is patched to Signal input. This isn't a default; it's deliberate. **+10V in 1V/octave tuning represents 10 octaves above reference, which is musically meaningful.** Make Noise could have made this empty (requiring you to patch a constant voltage source), but instead they designed channels 2 and 3 to reveal a synthesis principle: **voltage references are fundamental.** Absence of a patch becomes a feature. This teaches that modular synthesis doesn't require external sources for everything; sometimes the module itself contains the mathematical relationships you need. Understanding this reveals that **Maths can perform complex mathematics entirely with its own internal references.**

**Connection to Maths:**
This design exposes how analog circuits naturally work. In real electronics, when no voltage is patched, the circuit still does something (generates a reference). Most modules hide this. Maths reveals it as a feature because it's teaching how analog systems actually operate.

**Recognition:**
You expect nothing to happen when Signal input is empty; you're surprised by Channels 2 & 3 behavior without patching.

**The Learning:**
Channels 2 & 3 generate +10V when unpatched. Use this as an offset voltage source, scale it with attenuverters, or patch your own CV to replace it. This reveals that **Maths contains built-in voltage references for self-contained mathematical operations.** The module is more intelligent than it appears.

---

### **Issue 5: "I patched my envelope to itself and things got really weird"**

**Root Cause:** Not understanding self-patching feedback and what analog computation means in practice.

**The WHY Explanation:**
When you patch a Maths output back to another channel's Signal input, you create a feedback loop. The output of one channel becomes input to another, which generates a new output, which influences the first channel again; instantly, with no digital delay. **This reveals something profound about analog computation: it happens in real-time with zero latency.** Digital systems process information in steps (sample, compute, output). Analog systems compute continuously. When you create feedback loops, you're watching **analog mathematics happen**: the circuit solves equations recursively without time passing. This can create self-modulating patches, chaotic behavior, or complex frequency interactions, depending on scaling. It's not a bug; **it's revealing how analog circuits actually work.**

**Connection to Maths:**
Self-patching teaches that Maths is a **real analog computer**, not just a digital emulation. The feedback happens at the speed of electricity. This is fundamentally different from digital processing.

**Recognition:**
You hear unexpected oscillation, self-modulation, or chaotic behavior when patching outputs back to inputs.

**The Learning:**
Self-patching creates instant feedback loops. This can be musical (self-modulating envelopes) or chaotic (runaway oscillation). Experiment with low attenuverter settings to control feedback intensity. This teaches that **analog computation differs fundamentally from digital processing**: feedback is instantaneous and continuous.

---

### **Issue 6: "Rise and Fall go from instant to 25 minutes; how is that even a useful range?"**

**Root Cause:** Not understanding what controls Rise/Fall time, and why the extreme range exists.

**The WHY Explanation:**
Rise and Fall don't just control speed; they control **the rate at which voltage accumulates on a capacitor.** At fast settings, the capacitor charges almost instantly (microseconds to milliseconds). At slow settings, it charges so gradually that 25 minutes is realistic. This range exists because **Maths performs analog integration**: the fundamental mathematical operation. Capacitors don't know about "musical" timing; they follow electrical laws. **The extreme range teaches that modulation in synthesis isn't just for typical ADSR timing.** You might want a 20-minute pad swell (extremely slow Rise), or FM modulation at audio rate (extremely fast). The range exists because **Maths is teaching you what analog computation actually is: voltage integration over time, at any timescale.** The range reveals the physics.

**Connection to Maths:**
This demonstrates that Maths operates at the electrical level, not just the musical level. Understanding the extreme range teaches how synthesis fundamentally works at the component level.

**Recognition:**
Confusion about why you'd ever need a 25-minute envelope; not understanding why the knobs control such extreme timescales.

**The Learning:**
Rise/Fall control capacitor charging rate, which is determined by electrical law, not musical convention. Fast settings enable audio-rate modulation (FM). Slow settings create hour-long ambient sweeps. **The extreme range is a feature of analog integration**, not a design quirk. This teaches that analog synthesis operates differently than digital approximations.

---

### **Issue 7: "I pressed Cycle and my envelope became a wobble; what just happened?"**

**Root Cause:** Not recognizing that envelopes and LFOs are the same mathematical operation.

**The WHY Explanation:**
The Cycle button makes Maths repeat its rise/fall cycle automatically instead of completing once and stopping. Suddenly Rise and Fall change meaning: they become LFO speed controls instead of envelope timing. This reveals a **synthesis truth that digital systems obscure: envelopes and LFOs are not different things.** They're the same voltage-generating principle running at different speeds. A slow oscillation is an LFO. The same oscillation at slower speed becomes an envelope. **The Cycle button makes this relationship visible and audible.** This teaches that in synthesis, categories like "envelope" and "LFO" are human labels for different use-cases, not fundamentally different types. Maths treats them as identical operations.

**Connection to Maths:**
This single button reveals that **Maths (and all synthesis) operates on unified principles.** Everything is voltage over time. The distinction between envelope and LFO is just speed. This is a profound teaching about synthesis architecture.

**Recognition:**
Surprise when Cycle button transforms envelope into LFO; not realizing they're the same operation at different speeds.

**The Learning:**
Cycle button = continuous repetition. Rise/Fall become LFO speeds. **An envelope IS an LFO;** the only difference is speed. This teaches that synthesis categories are convenient labels, not fundamental divisions. Understanding this changes how you think about all modulation.

---

### **Issue 8: "Why does turning the attenuverter to negative sound so different than just reducing the positive amount?"**

**Root Cause:** Treating negative scaling as just "less" instead of as polarity inversion.

**The WHY Explanation:**
A positive attenuverter amplifies the input signal. A negative attenuverter inverts it: **flips the electrical polarity.** This isn't a subtle difference; it's a fundamental mathematical reversal. If an LFO swings from +5V to -5V, turning the attenuverter to +50% sends +2.5V to -2.5V. Turning it to -50% sends -2.5V to +2.5V. **The effect is inverted.** Musically, this creates opposite modulation direction. A LFO that opens your filter when turned positive will close your filter when turned negative. This teaches that **synthesis operates on mathematical polarity;** inversion is as important as amplitude. Make Noise made negative attenuverters possible specifically to teach this principle.

**Connection to Maths:**
Understanding polarity inversion teaches why attenuverters are multipliers, not volume controls. You're scaling both amplitude and mathematical direction simultaneously.

**Recognition:**
Expecting negative scaling to just be a weaker effect; being surprised that it changes modulation direction entirely.

**The Learning:**
Negative scaling inverts polarity. This creates opposite musical effects from positive scaling. **Understand that attenuverters control both amplitude and mathematical direction.** Negative modulation is not "less positive"; it's an inverted signal. This is a core synthesis principle.

---

### **Issue 9: "Can I really use Maths as a mixer? That seems like a weird use for it"**

**Root Cause:** Not understanding that SUM works through analog addition (Kirchhoff's Law), not just signal combining.

**The WHY Explanation:**
The SUM output automatically adds the voltages from all four channels together. If Ch1 Variable outputs +2V, Ch2 outputs +1V, Ch3 outputs -3V, and Ch4 outputs +4V, the SUM outputs +4V (the mathematical sum). **This isn't a "mixer feature" bolted onto an envelope generator.** It's the fundamental nature of analog circuits: **when voltages meet at a node, they add.** Make Noise exposed this as a feature by creating the SUM output. This teaches that **in modular synthesis, mixing is literally voltage addition.** When you combine four independent CV sources, you're creating a new control voltage that none of them produced alone. This is how **analog modular systems create complex relationships**: everything combines mathematically at every junction.

**Connection to Maths:**
Understanding SUM teaches the interconnection principle: **modular synthesis works because signals combine mathematically.** Maths reveals this fundamental truth about how analog systems actually operate.

**Recognition:**
Using Maths primarily for envelopes and overlooking the mathematical combining power of SUM; not understanding why SUM is musically useful.

**The Learning:**
SUM is analog voltage addition. Four independent sources combined create new mathematical relationships. This teaches that **modular synthesis achieves complexity through mathematical combination at every junction.** SUM isn't a mixing convenience; it's revealing how analog circuits naturally work.

---

### **Issue 10: "I patched my sequencer to a channel and turned the attenuverter, but when I tried Cycle mode it didn't work the way I expected"**

**Root Cause:** Not understanding how patching breaks normalization and changes the input behavior.

**The WHY Explanation:**
When you don't patch Signal input, Channels 2 and 3 generate +10V (a voltage reference). When you patch a sequencer CV, it replaces that +10V with the sequencer output. But if you also have Cycle ON, Maths treats the sequencer as a signal following input, not as a triggering source. **The sequencer CV becomes modulation that the envelope tracks, rather than steps that trigger envelopes.** This reveals how normals work: **unpatched = default behavior (generating +10V), patched = replacing the default.** Understanding this teaches that **modular systems use normals strategically to provide intelligent default behavior.** When you patch, you're breaking that default and replacing it with something else. The system changes behavior based on what you patch.

**Connection to Maths:**
This reveals Make Noise's design philosophy: **smart defaults when unpatched, flexible behavior when patched.** It teaches that in modular synthesis, **the absence of a patch is as important as the presence of one.**

**Recognition:**
Unexpected behavior when patching into channels that previously worked with normals; Cycle mode behaving differently than expected when patched.

**The Learning:**
Unpatched Signal input uses +10V (Channels 2&3) or follows gate normally. Patching replaces that behavior. Cycle mode processes whatever is patched as modulation, not as gates. **Understanding normals teaches how modular systems provide intelligent defaults.**

---

### **Issue 11: "I want to use Maths as an LFO but my envelope sounds too stiff"**

**Root Cause:** Misunderstanding Rise/Fall as shape controls instead of as time constants.

**The WHY Explanation:**
Rise and Fall aren't creating "shapes" (like a saw wave vs sine wave). They're **controlling the rate of voltage accumulation through capacitor charging.** Fast Rise means voltage jumps up almost instantly; slow Rise means it takes minutes. **The envelope "shape" emerges from the physics of capacitor charging**: it's always a curve determined by electrical time constants. Digital systems let you choose shapes (linear, exponential, ease-in). **Maths has one shape per channel: the mathematical curve of capacitor integration.** This reveals that **in analog synthesis, there's no "choosing" the envelope shape in the way digital systems work.** The shape emerges from physics. Understanding this teaches that **analog computation operates through different principles than digital modeling**: you don't choose curves, you let electrical law create them.

**Connection to Maths:**
This teaches that Maths performs **real analog mathematics**, not digital approximations. The envelope shape isn't chosen; it's inherent to the operation. This is fundamental to understanding analog synthesis.

**Recognition:**
Expecting to control envelope shape or create different curve types; finding Maths envelopes sound "stiff" compared to digital expectations.

**The Learning:**
Rise/Fall are time constants, not shape controls. **The curve emerges from capacitor charging physics.** One channel, one shape. This teaches that analog computation is fundamentally different from digital modeling. Understanding this changes how you approach analog synthesis design.

---

### **Issue 12: "I'm using positive attenuverters on all channels but my SUM output isn't as strong as I expected"**

**Root Cause:** Not understanding how attenuverter scaling multiplies the input signal, and how four small voltages combine differently than one large voltage.

**The WHY Explanation:**
If each channel is set to +50% and receives a +2V input, each outputs +1V. When you sum them (1+1+1+1), you get +4V; not as much as a single +8V source. This reveals how **mathematical scaling works: the attenuverter multiplies the input, it doesn't amplify it to a fixed output.** This teaches a crucial synthesis principle: **when you're mixing control voltages, you're combining scaled versions of different sources.** The mathematical relationships matter. If you want strong modulation, you need either a strong input or a high attenuverter setting. This reveals that **modulation design requires understanding both sources and scaling factors.**

**Connection to Maths:**
Understanding this teaches that in modular synthesis, **understanding mathematical relationships (input × multiplier = output) is essential to patch design.** SUM isn't a magic combiner; it's a mathematical truth.

**Recognition:**
Expecting SUM to be louder or stronger when all attenuverters are high; not understanding why SUM appears weak.

**The Learning:**
Attenuverters multiply the input signal, they don't amplify to a fixed output. If Ch1 Input is +2V and attenuverter is +50%, output is +1V. **SUM combines these scaled outputs.** Strong modulation requires strong inputs or high attenuverter settings. Understanding this teaches that **synthesis design is fundamentally about mathematical relationships**, not just signal combining.
