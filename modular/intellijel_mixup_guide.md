## Quick Start: Get Your First Stereo Mix in 5 Minutes

**What is Mixup?** A versatile 6HP stereo mixer that combines multiple audio sources with independent level controls and mute switches. It can be chained with other Mixup modules to create larger mixing systems for complex modular patches.

### Your First Stereo Mix Setup
1. **Connect audio sources** - Patch your voices into IN 1, IN 2, and IN 3L/3R inputs
2. **Set input levels** - Use LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2, and LEVEL 3 knobs to balance your mix
3. **Use mute controls** - MUTE 1, MUTE 2, and MUTE 3 switches for performance control
4. **Take your mix** - Final stereo mix appears at MIX L and MIX R outputs
5. **Monitor levels** - Watch the CLIP LED to avoid overloading the mix bus

**Congratulations!** You've just created a professional stereo mix with independent channel control!

## Essential Parameters (The Mix Controls)

### **1. LEVEL 1 Knob - Input 1 Volume Control**
- **What it does:** Controls the volume of IN 1 (mono input) sent to both MIX L and MIX R outputs
- **Character:** Logarithmic audio taper for smooth volume control across entire range
- **Signal routing:** IN 1 appears at both left and right mix outputs (mono to stereo)
- **Input impedance:** Optimized for modular audio sources
- **Pro tip:** Start with moderate levels to leave headroom for additional sources

### **2. LEVEL 2 Knob - Input 2 Volume Control**
- **What it does:** Controls the volume of IN 2 (mono input) sent to both MIX L and MIX R outputs
- **Character:** Same logarithmic audio taper as LEVEL 1 for consistent feel
- **Signal routing:** IN 2 appears at both left and right mix outputs (mono to stereo)
- **Purpose:** Independent level control for second mono source
- **Pro tip:** Use for secondary voices or modulation sources that need separate level control

### **3. LEVEL 3 Knob - Input 3 Stereo Volume Control**
- **What it does:** Controls the volume of both IN 3L and IN 3R simultaneously
- **Character:** Shared control for stereo pair with logarithmic audio taper
- **Signal routing:** IN 3L → MIX L, IN 3R → MIX R (true stereo)
- **Mono usage:** If only IN 3L connected, signal appears at both MIX L and MIX R
- **Pro tip:** Perfect for stereo sources like reverb returns or stereo oscillators

### **4. MUTE 1 Switch - Input 1 On/Off Control**
- **What it does:** Completely removes IN 1 from both MIX outputs when engaged (down position)
- **Character:** Hard mute with no audio bleed-through
- **Usage:** Performance control for bringing voices in and out of mix
- **AC-coupled design:** Minimizes pops when muting/unmuting audio signals
- **Pro tip:** Essential for live performance and dynamic mix changes

### **5. MUTE 2 Switch - Input 2 On/Off Control**
- **What it does:** Completely removes IN 2 from both MIX outputs when engaged (down position)
- **Character:** Same hard mute behavior as MUTE 1
- **Purpose:** Independent performance control for second mono input
- **Operation:** Up = signal passes, Down = signal muted
- **Pro tip:** Combine with MUTE 1 for call-and-response performance techniques

### **6. MUTE 3 Switch - Input 3 Stereo On/Off Control**
- **What it does:** Simultaneously mutes both IN 3L and IN 3R when engaged (down position)
- **Character:** Shared mute control for stereo pair
- **Purpose:** Performance control for stereo sources
- **Behavior:** Affects both channels of stereo input simultaneously
- **Pro tip:** Great for dropping stereo effects or textural elements during performance

### **7. IN 4L/4R - Unity Gain Auxiliary Inputs**
- **What they do:** Direct stereo inputs to mix bus with no level or mute control
- **Character:** Unity gain (no amplification or attenuation)
- **Signal routing:** IN 4L → MIX L, IN 4R → MIX R, no front panel controls
- **Mono usage:** If only IN 4L connected, signal appears at both MIX L and MIX R
- **Pro tip:** Use for sources that need consistent level or quick patch additions

### **8. CLIP LED - Mix Level Indicator**
- **What it does:** Lights when the sum of all inputs causes MIX L or MIX R to clip
- **Character:** Indicates overload of internal mix bus before outputs
- **Sources monitored:** All front panel inputs plus any CHAIN-IN signals
- **Prevention:** Reduce LEVEL knobs when LED lights to maintain clean output
- **Pro tip:** Some LED activity is acceptable, but constant lighting indicates excessive levels

## Why MixUp Excels

MixUp solves the problem that every Eurorack system eventually faces: multiple audio voices need to be combined into a single stereo output, and the options for doing so with adequate level control and minimal signal degradation at reasonable HP cost are fewer than they should be.

**Stereo from the start.** MixUp treats each of its four input channels as a mono source panned to a stereo field, with individual pan control per channel. The two output busses (main L/R mix and the auxiliary output) are both stereo. Many small mixers in Eurorack offer mono-sum outputs or require patching two separate mono channels together to approximate stereo. MixUp produces genuine stereo from four independent mono sources without additional hardware.

**The auxiliary output enables parallel processing or headphone monitoring without splitting the signal.** The auxiliary bus receives the pre-fader signal from any channel assigned to it. This allows a voice to go simultaneously to the main mix and to a parallel effects chain, or allows the main mix to go to modular outputs while the auxiliary feeds headphones or a recording interface. Both use cases require zero additional buffering or splitting.

**In a 1U format.** MixUp fits into Intellijel's 1U tile row (the same row as power supply tiles, MIDI tiles, and other 1U utilities). A 3U mixer in Eurorack typically costs between 10HP and 20HP of primary rack space. MixUp uses none of that primary space. For systems where 3U rack space is at a premium and a 1U tile row is available, MixUp is one of the most efficient ways to resolve the mixing problem.

## Why MixUp Has Limitations

MixUp is a final-stage stereo mixer, not a modular routing hub. It has no CV control over levels, no submix bussing for groups of voices, and no insert points for per-channel effects. If your mixing needs grow to include any of those features, a different mixer becomes appropriate. MixUp does what it does with minimal complexity; that simplicity is its value and its constraint simultaneously.

---

## Common Mistakes

**1. Expecting the AUX bus to be an independent mix.**
The auxiliary output reflects pre-fader signal from channels assigned to it, not an independently leveled submix. If a channel's level knob is at unity, the AUX output receives the full signal regardless of the main output level for that channel. If you need an independently leveled submix for an effects send, assign channels to AUX and adjust the AUX send level separately. Treating AUX as a post-fader send produces unexpected level relationships.

**2. Clipping the output by running hot levels on all four channels simultaneously.**
MixUp's headroom is limited by Eurorack signal levels. Four channels each running at full output -- particularly from voices with strong transients like drum modules -- can sum to a level that exceeds the output stage's clean range. Watch the clip indicator. Reduce individual channel levels rather than trying to compensate with downstream attenuation; catching the clip at the source produces cleaner audio than trying to reduce a clipped signal later.

**3. Patching the AUX output expecting it to carry the full stereo mix.**
The AUX bus only carries channels explicitly assigned to it. If you plug a channel into AUX and expect to hear your full mix, you will only hear those specific channels. Assign all four channels to AUX if you want the full mix there, or use the main L/R outputs for the primary mix and AUX only for channels you want to process separately.

**4. Overlooking MixUp because it lives in a 1U row.**
Users without 1U cases never see MixUp as an option. Users with 1U rows sometimes overlook it because the 1U row tends to be treated as infrastructure (power, I/O, MIDI) rather than signal processing. MixUp belongs in the mixing infrastructure category alongside those other tiles, and is often the most efficient solution available for its form factor.
