# Make Noise Pressure Points - Guide

![Make Noise Pressure Points](https://github.com/Shadoe-42/music/raw/main/modular/images/make_noise/pressure_points/front_panel.jpg)
*Touch-sensitive analog performance controller with 4 copper touch plates, 3 tuned voltage rows (X, Y, Z), and individual gate/pressure outputs for direct human-to-synthesis interface control*

**The Touch-Sensitive Analog Performance Controller**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Touch-Controlled Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Pressure Points?** A touch-sensitive analog controller where you become part of the circuit. Touch the copper plates with bare fingers to select one of 4 stages, each containing 3 tuned voltages that you've preset. The harder you press, the more control voltage you generate. Think "analog sequencer played by hand" - it's a direct physical interface between your touch and analog synthesis circuits.

### Your First Touch-Controlled Melody
1. **Ensure clean, bare hands** - oils and dirt affect sensitivity
2. **Connect Tuned Voltage Y** → **VCO 1V/Oct input**
3. **Connect Common Gate Output** → **Envelope generator trigger input**
4. **Connect envelope output** → **VCA control input**
5. **Set sensitivity** - Turn Digit Trimmer (panel control) clockwise until light touch activates plates
6. **Tune your notes** - Set Row Y potentiometers to different pitches across the 4 stages
7. **Touch and play** - Light touch on plates 1-4 triggers different notes!

**Congratulations!** You've just created a touch-controlled analog keyboard where your finger pressure controls the synthesis!

## Understanding the Pressure Points Philosophy

### **What Makes This Controller Special:**
Pressure Points transforms **human touch into analog control voltages** with exquisite sensitivity. You literally become part of the synthesizer circuit - your skin conductivity, moisture level, and applied pressure all affect the generated voltages. It's not just a controller, it's an **analog interface between human expression and electronic music**.

### **The Touch-Circuit Integration Concept:**
- **Conductive touch plates:** Printed copper circuits that respond to skin contact
- **Pressure-to-voltage conversion:** Physical pressure becomes proportional control voltage
- **Stage-based preset system:** 4 stages, each storing 3 independent tuned voltages
- **Dual outputs per stage:** Both gate (on/off) and pressure (variable) signals
- **Analog sensitivity:** Responds to finger size, skin moisture, and pressure variations

### **The Complete Architecture:**
1. **4 Touch Plates:** Conductive copper surfaces requiring clean, bare finger contact
2. **12 Tuned Voltages:** 3 voltage rows (X, Y, Z) with 4 settings each (one per stage)
3. **8 Individual Outputs:** Separate gate and pressure outputs for each of the 4 stages  
4. **3 Common Outputs:** Combined X, Y, Z tuned voltages from the active stage
5. **2 Bus Outputs:** Common gate and pressure outputs from whichever stage is active

### **Why This Matters:**
This system provides **direct physical control** over analog synthesis parameters with human expression that can't be replicated by traditional controllers. Every subtle change in finger pressure, contact area, and skin condition becomes part of the musical performance.

## Essential Parameters (The Touch Interface)

### **Touch Plates 1-4 - The Performance Surface**
- **Material:** Printed copper circuits requiring direct skin contact
- **Technique:** Light touch on upper portion activates gate; increased pressure generates variable CV
- **Sensitivity:** Responds to finger size, skin moisture, pressure, and contact area
- **Performance:** Clean, bare hands essential - oils, dirt, and gloves prevent proper operation
- **Visual feedback:** Bright LED indicates which stage is currently active

### **Digit Trimmer - Touch Sensitivity Control**
- **Function:** Adjusts overall touch sensitivity to accommodate different finger sizes and skin types
- **Range:** 40% clockwise is factory default; more clockwise increases sensitivity
- **Applications:** Compensate for dry skin, smaller fingers, or vertical mounting orientation
- **Access:** Requires small screwdriver; located on right side of circuit board
- **Adjustment:** Turn power OFF when adjusting; find sweet spot through experimentation

### **Tuned Voltage Rows X, Y, Z - The Preset System**

#### **Row X (Top): 0 to 8V Range**
- **Primary use:** Control voltages, gate voltages when set to extremes
- **Musical applications:** Filter cutoff, oscillator FM amount, envelope attack/decay times
- **Gate trick:** Full clockwise = gate HIGH, full counter-clockwise = gate LOW
- **4 stages:** Each touch plate selects its corresponding column potentiometer

#### **Row Y (Middle): 0 to 5.5V Range**  
- **Primary use:** 1V/octave pitch control for musical sequences
- **Musical applications:** Melodic sequences, bass lines, chord progressions
- **Tuning:** Approximately 5.5 octaves of pitch control range
- **Performance:** Most common row for melodic touch-keyboard applications

#### **Row Z (Bottom): 0 to 5.5V Range**
- **Primary use:** Secondary control voltages, modulation amounts
- **Musical applications:** Resonance, pulse width, LFO rate, delay time
- **Flexibility:** Same range as Y row but typically used for timbral parameters
- **Integration:** Often used for parameters that complement the Y row pitch changes

### **Output System - Gates and Pressure**

#### **Individual Stage Outputs (1-4)**
- **Gate outputs:** Digital on/off signal when corresponding touch plate is activated
- **Pressure outputs:** Analog CV proportional to applied finger pressure and contact area
- **Range:** Gate = 0V to +8V; Pressure = 0V to variable maximum based on pressure
- **Applications:** Independent control of multiple synthesis voices or parameters

#### **Common/Bus Outputs**
- **Common Gate:** Active whenever ANY touch plate is pressed
- **Common Pressure:** Pressure CV from whichever stage is currently active
- **Tuned Voltage Outputs:** X, Y, Z voltages from the currently selected stage
- **Normalization:** Individual outputs are normalized to bus outputs for simple patching

## Touch Technique Mastery

### **Proper Finger Placement:**
- **Contact point:** Touch upper portion of copper plate with fingertip
- **Pressure progression:** Light touch activates gate; increased pressure raises CV level
- **Contact area:** More finger surface contact increases pressure CV output
- **Movement:** Slide between plates for legato playing; lift and press for staccato

### **Sensitivity Optimization:**
- **Clean hands essential:** Wash hands; remove oils, lotions, dirt that interfere with conductivity
- **Skin moisture:** Slightly moist skin improves contact; overly dry skin reduces sensitivity
- **Finger size compensation:** Larger fingers may need less sensitivity; smaller fingers need more
- **Environmental factors:** Humidity, temperature, and installation angle affect response

### **Performance Techniques:**
- **Dynamic touch:** Vary pressure for expressive modulation during sustained notes
- **Multi-finger techniques:** Use multiple fingers simultaneously for chord-like effects
- **Slide techniques:** Smooth transitions between plates for portamento effects
- **Rhythmic patterns:** Develop consistent touch patterns for rhythmic sequences

### **Troubleshooting Touch Response:**
- **No response:** Check hand cleanliness, increase sensitivity, verify power connections
- **Inconsistent response:** Adjust Digit Trimmer, clean copper plates gently with dry cloth
- **Over-sensitive:** Reduce Digit Trimmer setting, ensure hands aren't overly moist
- **Weak pressure CV:** Increase applied pressure, check individual vs common output routing
