# Guide Creation Framework

**Essential requirements for systematic guide creation**

---

## **Integration with Project Philosophy**

This framework implements the interconnectedness principle from `project_philosophy.md` - teaching how modules connect within systems, not just isolated features.

**For philosophical foundation:** See `project_philosophy.md` for WHY systematic documentation matters (generational teaching, ~500 instruments, interconnection principle).

**For operational discipline:** See `framework_overview.md` for WHY systematic standards maintain system integrity (teaching obligation, mise en place, consequence model).

**For applying these standards:** See `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` for systematic enhancement approach (transforming guides from procedural to understanding-focused).

**For visual presentation:** See `visual_communication_standards.md` for diagram and image integration standards.

**For verification:** See `quality_system.md` and `verification_strategy.md` for ensuring accuracy and reliability.

## **Content Structure & Quality**

### **Required Sections:**
1. **Quick Start** - 5-minute success path
2. **Essential Parameters** - Core controls with CV information
3. **Patch Examples** - Count per module classification above
4. **Common Use Cases** - Real-world applications
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues
6. **Pairs Well With** - Integration suggestions with alternatives
7. **What This Unlocks From Your Existing Gear** (Optional but Strongly Encouraged) - Include when module creates genuine new possibilities with commonly-owned equipment

### **Official Section Ordering (Updated 2025-11-18)**

**Authoritative sequence for all guides:**

1. **Quick Start** - First sound in 5 minutes, builds confidence immediately
2. **Essential Parameters** - Learn the controls before understanding philosophy
3. **Historical Context** - Ground understanding in module's place in synthesis/music history (when educationally valuable)
4. **Algorithm Reference / Key Specifications** - Provide reference material for the sections that follow (where applicable)
5. **Why This Instrument Excels** - Set philosophical and architectural context before practical application
6. **Patch Examples** - Apply learning through hands-on patches; guides encounter common mistakes here
7. **Common Mistakes & Pattern Recognition** - Supportive troubleshooting after practice; reveals synthesis principles through problems encountered
8. **Pairs Well With** - Show integration possibilities after user has hands-on experience
9. **Advanced Learning Path** - Growth trajectory after mastery of basics

**Rationale for this ordering:**

- **Sections 1-4 (Foundation):** Build technical competency and historical context before abstract philosophy
- **Section 5 (Philosophy):** Inspire with design understanding after establishing foundation
- **Sections 6-7 (Application & Learning):** Patches come first so users encounter mistakes naturally; troubleshooting becomes supportive, not cautionary
- **Sections 8-9 (Integration & Growth):** Advanced content after core mastery

**Why this sequence matters:**
- Quick Start builds immediate success (user confidence)
- Essential Parameters + Historical Context establish competency (user understanding)
- Why This Excels sets vision (user inspiration) AFTER understanding controls
- Patches let user discover real-world problems (user experience)
- Common Mistakes provides supportive guidance AFTER user has tried (user learning)
- Advanced content comes last (user growth trajectory)

**Pattern Discovery Note:** This ordering emerged from Erica Synths Pico DRUM2 enhancement (November 2025), where placing Common Mistakes before Patch Examples created tonal dissonance (excitement → caution), while moving it after patches created natural flow (vision → practice → learning from experience → growth). This sequence now applies to all guides.

### **Key Specifications Placement (Critical for Evaluation)**

**Location:** Within Quick Start section, immediately after "What is [Module]?" description, before "Your First [Experience]"

**Mandatory Format:**
```
**Key Specifications:**
- **Width:** [X] HP
- **Depth:** [X] mm
- **Power:** [X] mA @ +12V / [X] mA @ -12V / [X] mA @ +5V
```

**Why This Placement:**
- Users read: Concept → Evaluate if fits system → Try it
- Specs are decision-making information, not learning material
- Before "Your First [Experience]" because users need to know fit before investing time
- Natural evaluation flow: "Is this for me?" (specs) → "Can I use it?" (first patch)

**Mandatory for all module guides:** No exceptions. Hardware constraints are deal-breakers.

**Format Rules:**
- **Width:** Always in HP (eurorack standard)
- **Depth:** Always in mm (case compatibility check)
- **Power:** Always show all three rails (+12V, -12V, +5V) even if one is 0 mA
- **Accuracy:** Verify against official documentation or Modular Grid

**Additional Module-Specific Details (Optional):**
If applicable, add module-specific technical specs:
- **Oscillators:** Frequency range, waveforms, modulation types
- **Filters:** Filter type, slope, frequency range
- **Sequencers:** Steps, tracks, clock options
- **Effects:** Sample rate, algorithm count, I/O types

**Example (Pico DRUM2):**
```
**Key Specifications:**
- **Width:** 3 HP
- **Depth:** 35 mm
- **Power:** 28 mA @ +12V / 5 mA @ -12V / 0 mA @ +5V
```

**Compliance Requirement:** Every guide must include Key Specifications in Quick Start. This is non-negotiable—users cannot evaluate module fit without this information.

### **"Existing Gear Integration" Section Guidelines:
**Include this section when:**
- Module genuinely opens up integration possibilities with common existing gear
- There are specific, practical examples that would excite users about new workflows
- The connections aren't already obvious from the patch examples
- The integration actually enhances the module's utility (not random gear mentions)

**Examples of good fits:**
- Interface modules (Stomp, audio interfaces, MIDI converters) - unlock pedals, studio gear, controllers
- Utility modules with unique capabilities - clock dividers (unlock drum machines), sample & holds (unlock field recorders)
- Modules that bridge different signal types - envelope followers (unlock dynamic mics, instruments)

**Skip this section when:**
- Module function is self-contained (basic VCAs, simple LFOs)
- Integration possibilities are already covered in patch examples
- Would require forced content rather than genuine discovery

**Quality test:** Does this section make someone think "I never realized I could do that with equipment I already have!" If not, skip it.

### **Mandatory Framework Compliance Requirements:**
**Based on systematic testing findings (2025-09-22) - these gaps appeared in 100% of tested guides**

1. **GitHub Image Integration (MANDATORY):**
   - **Format:** `![Module Name](https://github.com/Shadoe-42/music/raw/main/modular/images/[module_name]/front_panel.jpg)`
   - **Caption:** Descriptive text about module interface and key elements
   - **Placement:** Immediately after title + tagline, before all content sections (provides immediate visual context)
   - **Non-negotiable:** Every guide must include proper GitHub image integration

2. **Enhanced Format Alternatives (MANDATORY - ALL PATCHES):**
   - **Required for EVERY patch:** Budget/Premium/Different character options
   - **Format:** Main Example + Alternative Options with specific module names
   - **Cannot be skipped:** Testing revealed systematic omission when not explicitly required
   - **All patches means ALL patches:** No exceptions for any patch in any guide

### **Quality Requirements:**
- **Interface accuracy** - Verify jack names against `comprehensive_interface_database.md`
- **No fabricated terminology** - Use actual module language
- **Educational progression** - Clear learning objectives
- **Module-specific language** - Honor manufacturer philosophy

- **GitHub images:** `![Module](https://github.com/Shadoe-42/music/raw/main/modular/images/[module]/front_panel.jpg)`

---

## **Language & Terminology Standards**

### **Required Language:**
- **Circuit-based descriptions** - No AI/intelligence references
- **"Advanced"** not "Phase 2" throughout all guides
- **Exact manufacturer terminology** - Honor module-specific language
- **Manufacturer + Module naming** - Always use "Manufacturer Module" format for consistency and searchability

**Module Naming Standards:**
- ✅ **Correct:** "Intellijel Stomp", "4ms Listen IO", "Make Noise Maths", "Erica Synths Pico Voice"
- ❌ **Incorrect:** "Stomp", "Listen IO", "Maths", "Pico Voice" (manufacturer missing)
- **Rationale:** Searchability (users look under manufacturer sections), clarity (multiple manufacturers may have similar names), framework consistency

**Naming Guidelines:**
- **First reference:** Always include full manufacturer name
- **Cross-references:** Always use full manufacturer + module name for guide linking
- **Alternative suggestions:** Include manufacturer names in module alternatives

### **Progression Terminology:**
- **Patches:** Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert
- **Integration:** "Advanced synergies" for multi-module coordination
- **System Design:** "Advanced integration" for complex networks

---

## **Historical Context (When Appropriate)**

### **Include Historical Context For:**
- **Historical significance** - Major synthesis milestones
- **Technical innovation** - Techniques that influenced the field
- **Cultural impact** - Widely adopted, influenced genres
- **Educational value** - Helps understand module importance

### **Examples:** Korg MS-20, Make Noise Maths, classic Moog modules, Buchla designs

### **Treatment:**
- **Factual information** about development/impact
- **2-3 paragraphs maximum**
- **Integrated into existing sections** not separate section
- **Educational focus** - module's place in synthesis history

---

## **Workflow Integration**

### **Mandatory Process:**
1. **Complete workflow checklist** from `workflow_checklist.md` before ANY guide work
2. **Show checklist to user** and get explicit approval
3. **Follow efficiency standards:** 1-2 function calls maximum for most operations

### **Never:**
- Bypass workflow checklist
- Start operations without user approval  
- Exceed promised function call count
- Skip accountability documentation

---

## **Framework Application**

### **For New Guides:**
1. Determine module classification
2. Complete workflow checklist
3. Single comprehensive write with mandatory compliance elements
4. **Verify framework compliance** using systematic testing criteria
5. Document results

### **For Guide Updates:**
1. Read entire existing guide
2. Complete workflow checklist for specific changes
3. **Check for systematic gaps** (GitHub image + enhanced format alternatives)
4. Targeted edits for small changes OR comprehensive compliance update
5. Record efficiency

### **Framework Compliance Verification (Enhanced 2025-09-22):**
**Comprehensive verification checklist - systematic testing revealed tunnel vision failures when verification was incomplete**

**Mandatory Checklist (ALL Requirements):**
- [ ] **GitHub image integration present** with proper URL format and descriptive caption
- [ ] **Enhanced format alternatives in ALL patches** (budget/premium/different character)
- [ ] **Terminology consistency** - "Advanced" not "Phase 2" throughout entire guide
- [ ] **Required sections complete** per module classification (Quick Start, Essential Parameters, etc.)
- [ ] **Interface accuracy verified** against official manuals
- [ ] **Language standards applied** - circuit-based descriptions, exact manufacturer terminology
- [ ] **Visual standards compliance** - signal coding, ASCII symbols, module boxes
- [ ] **Historical context appropriateness** - included when educationally valuable, properly integrated
- [ ] **Cross-references functional** - links to other guides work correctly
- [ ] **Educational progression clear** - learning objectives and skill development milestones

**Testing Evidence & Tunnel Vision Prevention:**
- **Instruo Arbhar guide:** Missing image + enhanced alternatives + terminology violations
- **Instruo Cs-L guide:** Missing image + enhanced alternatives + terminology violations  
- **Pattern:** Tunnel vision on specific gaps missed comprehensive framework verification
- **Solution:** Complete checklist prevents partial compliance claims
- **Critical understanding:** "Framework compliance" means ALL requirements, not just targeted fixes

### **Emergency Protocols:**
- **File operation failure:** Stop immediately, diagnose, ask for guidance
- **Efficiency targets missed:** Document actual performance, analyze causes
- **Quality issues:** Address using quality system protocols
- **Framework compliance gaps:** Use systematic testing criteria to identify and resolve

---

## **Pattern Refinement Notes (November 2025)**

### **Discovery: 4-5 Core Common Mistakes Standard**

**Session:** Erica Synths Pico DRUM2 enhancement

**Finding:** The original framework requirement of "8-12 common mistakes" was too rigid. Testing revealed:
- **Utility modules** rarely have 8-12 legitimate beginner issues (forcing to count requires edge cases)
- **Creative modules** better served by 4-5 core mistakes that teach foundational principles
- **Quality principle:** Four deeply explained mistakes teaching synthesis principles beats twelve padded issues
- **Teaching obligation:** Stretching to hit numbers dishonors the interconnection principle

**Decision:** Minimum 4-5 core common mistakes (not 8-12). Additional issues only if they genuinely exist and teach something new.

**Application:** This standard now applies to all guide enhancements going forward. Pico DRUM2 serves as reference implementation with 4 core mistakes that explain 90% of beginner problems.

### **Discovery: Official Section Ordering**

**Session:** Erica Synths Pico DRUM2 enhancement

**Finding:** Without prescribed section order, guides varied structurally, and content placement affected pedagogical flow. Specific problem:
- Placing "Common Mistakes" immediately after "Why This Excels" created tonal dissonance (excitement → caution)
- Moving "Common Mistakes" after "Patch Examples" created natural pedagogical flow (inspire → practice → learn from experience)

**Decision:** Adopted authoritative section ordering (documented above) that sequences content by learning stage: foundation → philosophy → application → learning → integration → growth.

**Impact:** This ordering aligns with user experience lifecycle and teaching obligation principle (guides become pedagogically sound, not just reference materials).

**Application:** All new guides and significant enhancements must follow this section ordering. Existing guides should be updated when feasible.

### **Cross-Documen Implications**

These refinements affect:
- `guide_creation_workflow.md` - Update section ordering references
- `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` - Update mistake count expectations
- All future guide enhancements - Follow 4-5 mistake standard and prescribed section ordering

---

**This framework provides essential requirements for systematic guide creation while integrating with established accountability systems.**
