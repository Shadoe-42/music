## Before You Start: Framework Understanding

### What Guides Must Accomplish

Guides teach **understanding and interconnection**, not procedures. This is not manufacturer documentation; it's knowledge transmission designed for generational learning.

**The core distinction:**
- **NOT:** "How to press buttons" (procedural)
- **YES:** "Why the design works this way" + "What goes wrong and why" + "How this teaches broader principles" (understanding)

### Non-Negotiables (All Guides, No Exceptions)

1. **Teach interconnection, not procedures** - Every significant feature shows how it connects to broader synthesis principles
2. **Verify or flag technical claims** - Specific numbers (voltage ranges, timing specs, firmware versions) must be verified or marked with ⚠️
3. **Include Common Mistakes section** - 3-5 issues with first-person frustrated quotes as headings, WHY explanations for each
4. **Use "Advanced," not "Phase 2"** - Consistent terminology throughout framework
5. **Enhanced format alternatives in all patches** - Budget/Premium/Different character options for every patch
6. **GitHub image integration** - Proper nested directory structure, descriptive captions

### Essential Vocabulary (Unified Definitions)

| Term | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|---|
| **Teaching Obligation** | When you learn, you inherit duty to teach others correctly. Knowledge compounds across generations. | Guides outlast their creators. Accuracy matters for future users. |
| **Mise en Place** | Professional discipline: prep before service gets chaotic. Applied to knowledge work: complete steps before execution. | System integrity depends on process adherence. |
| **Interconnection** | Everything relates to everything. Guides show HOW. | Teaching understanding (not procedures) reveals connections that persist across tech changes. |
| **Enhanced Format** | Guides go beyond "how to use" to "why it works and what connections exist." | Transforms procedural documentation into deep understanding. |
| **Verification/Flagging** | Technical claims are verified against official docs or marked with ⚠️ if uncertain. | Wrong specs multiply across generations; accuracy is non-negotiable. |
| **Holistic vs. Tactical** | Holistic: maintain system integrity for ALL future work. Tactical: complete this task efficiently. | Choose holistic thinking. Shortcuts degrade the entire system. |

### Module Classifications (Choose One)

Your guide classification determines required sections and patch count:

| Classification | Examples | Required Patches | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Utility (2-3)** | Mixers, VCAs, Clocks | 2-3 | Technical operation, system integration |
| **Creative (4-5)** | Oscillators, Filters, Drums | 4-5 | Musical exploration, sound design |
| **Multi-Function (4-5)** | Disting, MetaModule, Hermod+ | 4-5 | Functional breadth, practical guidance |
| **Complete Synthesizer (4-5)** | Desktop synths, grooveboxes | 4-5 | Studio integration, performance |
| **Studio Equipment (3-4)** | Interfaces, processors | 3-4 | Workflow integration, professional techniques |

## Your Workflow: By Process Stage

### **Stage 1: Plan Your Work**

**What you decide here:**
- Is this a new guide or enhancement?
- Which module classification applies?
- How many patches will you create?
- What compliance requirements apply?

**Your reference checklist:**

- [ ] **Module classification identified** - Utility/Creative/Multi-Function/Complete Synth/Studio Equipment
- [ ] **Required patches determined** - 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5 patches based on classification
- [ ] **Existing guide read** (if enhancing) - Understand current state before planning changes
- [ ] **Required sections listed** - Quick Start, Essential Parameters, Patch Examples, Common Use Cases, Troubleshooting, Pairs Well With
- [ ] **Enhanced format alternatives planned** - Budget/Premium/Different character for each patch
- [ ] **GitHub images located/planned** - Proper nested directory structure (`modular/images/manufacturer/module_name/`)
- [ ] **Technical claims identified** - Which specs need verification vs. flagging

**When to read what:**
- New guide? → Read `guide_creation_framework.md` "Module Classifications & Requirements" section
- Enhancing? → Read `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` "Enhancement Pattern" section for methodology

---

### **Stage 2: Execute Enhancement**

**Your actual working process:**

**Step 1: Complete the Workflow Checklist** (from `workflow_checklist.md`)
- File analysis (current state, change scope, efficiency estimation)
- Pre-execution verification (requirements check, success criteria)
- User confirmation (show checklist, get approval before proceeding)

**Step 2: Know Your Enhancement Approach**

**For targeted edits (most work):**
- Use `edit_file` function calls (surgical precision, shows exactly what changed)
- Add one section or fix at a time
- Create clear git diffs for review
- Teach correct patterns to Future Claude

**NOT:** Avoid `write_file` rewrites unless:
- Creating completely new guides from scratch
- File is fundamentally broken
- User explicitly approves complete rewrite

**Step 3: Follow the WHY Approach** (from `guide_enhancement_pattern.md`)

For every significant feature or section, explain:
1. **What it does** (basic description)
2. **Why it exists** (design rationale)
3. **How it works technically** (mechanism)
4. **When to use it** (musical context)
5. **What goes wrong** (common mistakes)

**Step 4: Add Missing Sections**

Check your guide has:
- [ ] **Why This Instrument Excels** - Philosophy + practical benefits + magic (emotional essence)
- [ ] **Common Mistakes** - 3-5 issues with first-person frustrated quotes as headings, WHY explanations
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition** - Root causes that explain 90% of issues
- [ ] **Enhanced Format Alternatives** - Budget/Premium/Different character for ALL patches
- [ ] **Learning Objectives** - Each patch states what transferable principles are taught
- [ ] **GitHub images** - Proper integration with descriptive captions

**Step 5: Verify Technical Accuracy**

Technical claims that need verification (mark with ⚠️ if uncertain):
- Voltage ranges (e.g., "-5V to +5V")
- Timing specs (e.g., "500ms")
- Firmware features (e.g., "requires v1.1+")
- Compatibility specs (e.g., "32GB SD maximum")
- Specific knob positions

Safe to include without verification:
- Conceptual explanations
- General synthesis principles
- Common issues
- Musical context

**When to read what:**
- Need detailed techniques? → `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` "Specific Enhancement Areas" and "Examples from Enhanced Guides"
- Need to understand WHY approach? → `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` "Core Philosophy" section
- Need verification guidance? → `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` "Quality Checklist: Technical Accuracy Requirements"
